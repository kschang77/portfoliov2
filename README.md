# portfoliov2

This is my redesigned portfolio. 

Yes, I am aware it is still a static page. However, it has been completely revamped.

And yes, It is meant to have a vaguely Star Trek pallette. These colors are from [LCARS pallette](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Library_Computer_Access_and_Retrieval_System). 

Page transition code originally created by [Marcelo Ribeiro](https://codepen.io/marcelo-ribeiro/pen/xOOKpO), adapted by Kasey Chang and modified for six panels AND text swapping.
